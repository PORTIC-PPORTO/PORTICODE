The intellectual property found within regards multiple ways to implement the edge computing paradigm. You will find several ways to implement a virtual machine that can act as an edge device, i.e. an IoT device that is meant to run locally, act as a transparent gateway between other local IoT devices and the azure cloud, and execute some form of operation before streaming the data into the cloud. These folders offer a working Azure "IoT Edge Runtime" ecosystem, which should be used as a starting point to run modules that are specific to each research project at PORTIC (Porto Research, Technology & Innovation Center).
